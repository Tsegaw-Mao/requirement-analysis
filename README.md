# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## About the Project
The **Requirement Analysis** Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## Learning Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer’s ability to:

- Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
- Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
- Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
- Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clarity and Understanding**: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Requirement Gathering**
- `Interviews`: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
- `Surveys`/`Questionnaires`: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
- `Workshops`: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
- `Observation`: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
- `Document Analysis`: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.
2. **Requirement Elicitation**
- `Brainstorming`: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
- `Focus Groups`: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
- `Prototyping`: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.
3. **Requirement Documentation**
- `Requirement Specification Document`: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
- `User Stories`: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
- `Use Cases`: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
- `Requirement Prioritization`: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
- `Feasibility Analysis`: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
- `Modeling`: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
5. **Requirement Validation**
- `Review and Approval`: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- `Acceptance Criteria`: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
- `Traceability`: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements
### **Functional Requirements**
**Definition**: Describe what the system should do.
**Examples**: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

#### Key Functional Requirements of booking management project from the case study:

- **Search + Booking Properties**: This is the service that will be given to customers. In this customers can search and book a hotel.
- **Hotel Management Service**: This is the service that will be given to hotel managers/owners. In this managers can manage their hotel's related information. Here managers have a separate portal to access the data and update it.
- **View Booking Service**: Here all current and old booking details are shown to the user. Both managers and customers use this service.

### **Non-functional Requirements**
**Definition**: Describe how the system should perform.
**Examples**: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

#### Key Non-functional Requirements of booking management project from the case study:

- **Security**: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
- **Usability**: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
- **Reliability**: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.
